PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT dataset.py, pretrained_models.py and utils.py are in the same folder as the jupyter notebook: RCNN_final.ipynb. Without this, the code will not run.


PLEASE UPDATE PATHS IN THE NOTEBOOK

pretrained_path = "path to checkpoint680.pth"

imgs_path = "path to data files"
masks_path= "path to data files"
labels_path= "path to data files"
bboxes_path= "path to data files"

model_path = "path to folder containing trained model"

 
There are no other special instructions for running this code. As long as dataset.py, pretrained_models.py and utils.py are in the same folder, the notebook should run without errors.

Please run the cells in SEQUENTIAL ORDER to avoid errors. There are additional instructions above each cell.
